Designed and developed a web game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery that challenges users to replicate increasingly complex patterns of sounds and colours
Implemented a randomized pattern generation algorithm that progressively increases in length each time the user successfully replicates the previous pattern.
Utilized JavaScript and jQuery to enhance the game's functionality, including features such as scorekeeping and DOM manipulation.

Note: Sounds are not able to work right now, they need to be placed in a folder named 'sounds'.
